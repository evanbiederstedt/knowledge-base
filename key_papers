# Key non-methodological papers

Either some reviews or important insides:

- [Evaluating methods of inferring gene regulatory networks highlights their lack of performance for single cell gene expression data](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2217-z): study shows that gene regulatory networks on single-cell don't work
  - Also was mentioned in [Best Practices](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20188746) from Theis

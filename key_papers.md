# Key non-methodological papers

Either some reviews or important insides:

- [Evaluating methods of inferring gene regulatory networks highlights their lack of performance for single cell gene expression data](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2217-z): study shows that gene regulatory networks on single-cell don't work
  - Also was mentioned in [Best Practices](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20188746) from Theis
- [Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4314): Comparison of UMAP with other methods
- [Accuracy, Robustness and Scalability of Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Single Cell RNAseq Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/641142): comparison of dimensionality reduction methods
